			"An HSF is a flavor of a CTF. The challenges are connected to a theme, and the goal is not to get the most flags, but to create the most convincing writeup.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a writeup?",
		answer:
			"A writeup is a collection of all the evidence and flags you have collected, and how you found them. Check out b1c's excellent writeup for MCPS HSF 2023.",
	},

		question: "What are the divisions?",

			"The competition is divided into a novice and advanced division. The novice division is for beginners, and the advanced division is for more experienced hackers.",

	{
		question: "Do I need experience?",
		answer:
			"No! This competition is for people for all skill levels. Also, winners are determined by the writeup and number of flags.",

	{
		question: "Are there prizes?",
		answer:
			"Yes! We had drones and GoPros last year. The top three in both the novice and advanced division win prizes.",
